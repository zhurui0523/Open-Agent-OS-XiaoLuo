* entry imports and renders LayoutSegmentProvider directly, but because of the
* "use client" boundary the actual execution happens on the SSR/client side
* where the context can be created and consumed by useSelectedLayoutSegment(s).
*
* Without "use client", this runs in the RSC environment where
* React.createContext is undefined, getLayoutSegmentContext() returns null,
* the provider becomes a no-op, and useSelectedLayoutSegments always returns [].
*
* The context is shared with navigation.ts via getLayoutSegmentContext()
* to avoid creating separate contexts in different modules.

* layout level add their own keys.
*
* Components inside the provider call useSelectedLayoutSegments(parallelRoutesKey)
